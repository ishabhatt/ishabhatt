## 🧠 About Me

Passionate about elevating software quality through strategic test engineering, I specialize in building **robust test automation frameworks**, driving **end-to-end quality initiatives**, and leading/mentoring **high-performing QA teams**. I’ve delivered complex enterprise solutions across domains, driving **efficiency, quality, and scale**.

I am experienced in both manual and automation testing across SaaS, embedded systems, and cloud-based applications. I’ve designed and maintained automation frameworks using Selenium, Python, Robot Framework, Java, Cypress with strong experience in REST API testing using Postman, and integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

I led QA efforts for cloud-hosted applications and worked closely with DevOps, developers, and product teams to drive quality throughout the SDLC. I’ve worked in Agile/DevOps environments and have experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, JMeter, and managing testing infrastructure in AWS and Azure.

 I am passionate about **scalable automation**, **high-quality software delivery**, and **continuous improvement**.
